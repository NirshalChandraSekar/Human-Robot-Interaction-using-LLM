  <h2 align="center">HUMAN ROBOT INTERACTION USING LLM</h2>
</p>

### About the project
The advancement of technology has enhanced daily comfort, yet there remains a gap in emotional support. Initially, robots were perceived as rigid and unapproachable, which made it challenging for users to rely on them for effective communication. To improve human-robot interaction, it is crucial for robots to understand human sentiments and empathize accordingly. With this objective in mind, our goal is to develop a social robot that users can depend on for companionship, guidance, and emotional support. The primary aim of this social robot is to generate empathetic responses based on the user's speech and provide objects that may be needed in a virtual environment.
